# Citi Bike Analysis Using Tableau

In this project, envision yourself as the new lead analyst for the New York Citi Bike program. You are now responsible for overseeing the largest bike-sharing program in the United States. In your new role, you will be expected to generate regular reports for city officials looking to publicize and improve the city program.

Since 2013, the Citi Bike program has implemented a robust infrastructure for collecting data on the program's utilization. Each month, bike data is collected, organized, and made public on the Citi Bike Data webpage.

However, while the data has been regularly updated, the team has yet to implement a dashboard or sophisticated reporting process. City officials have questions about the program, so your first task on the job is to build a set of data reports to provide the answers.

## Deployment

Please find below the link to the Tableau dashboard, showcasing the results of the analysis:

## Data Source

The data was collected from [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data)

1.The initial stage of the project involved acquiring all the monthly CSV files, covering the period from January 2023 to December 20203 from the [Citi Bike Data](https://www.citibikenyc.com/system-data) webpage and organizing them in a designated folder named "data". The data used in this analysis specifically pertains to the Jersey City region.

2. Subsequently, I established a Jupyter Notebook file, named "citibikeanalysis.ipynb", to systematically clean and combine all the monthly CSV files into a single CSV file, in preparation for importing into Tableau.

## Dashboards

From the Citi Bike data, a homepage and four corresponding dashboards were created to provide a comprehensive analysis and visualization of the data.

### Homepage

The homepage serves as an introduction to the project, providing a concise overview of its purpose and contents. It clearly summarizes the key insights and findings of each dashboard, allowing for quick and easy navigation.
